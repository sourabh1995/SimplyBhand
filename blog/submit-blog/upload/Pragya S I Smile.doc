<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	I look into your eyes and smile. Fact is, there is nothing else for me to do. I could just as well have been</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	screaming, ranting or railing. But that wouldn&amp;#39;t do any good would it? Perhaps it would get the</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	attention of the dozen people around me. Maybe, someone would come and ask me what is really</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	wrong.</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	Perhaps, someone would offer to help me. But I know from past experience that that is far as it would</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	go. Because, in this world there is no help and no relief. You are born alone and you will die alone. At</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	times, you can cry. That may let you feel lighter. But then, that will at most win you some sympathy and</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	at worst you&amp;#39;ll just find your problems broadcasted all over the rumor mill.</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	So, smile. I smile, even though it quite frankly hurts my jaw and laugh uproariously at the stupidest and</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	most insensitive of jokes. My smile is my armor. One day, you&amp;#39;ll realize that people are like vultures.</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	Always looking for weaknesses they can exploit. Know that you are alone.</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	People say there&amp;#39;s strength in numbers. But there&amp;#39;s a very subtle strength in being alone. To know that</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	there&amp;#39;s no one standing behind you, yet knowing you can take being knocked down and still stand up</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"cke_pastebin\"> 	smiling!</div>
