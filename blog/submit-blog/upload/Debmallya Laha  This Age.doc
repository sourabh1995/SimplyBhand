<p> 	Arrival of humans on this planet is thought of to be in the recent times when we consider the time since earth was created.</p> <p> 	Many ages have passed by as the earth undwent several geological and climatic modifications, before the humans arrived. So yes, humans are younger than many other species in this planet. What seperates the humans over other living beings, on this planet.? Why are humans and their requirements so dominant all over the earth.? Yes, of course it is our brain, according to me which is the most powerful existing technology in the earth, a beautiful creation. But is brain the only answer? Succes of the humans are also due to his sharpened conciousness and will power.</p> <p> 	The brain, the will power, the sharpened conciousness &nbsp;have brought great power to the humans. But it is the achievement of this very great power that today, poses a threat to the whole world like it never did before. It is believed that with great power should come great responsibility, but humans have shown utter callousness in the use of the great power that they possess, leading to two world wars. Civilizations of species have faced extinction, in the past, but none did face the threat to extinction as the humans do. Clearly the reason being the humans themselves. Recent incidents of unrest are very popular all over the world. With achievement of power came the greed for more power, which resulted in human assault over their own fellow beings and not only that, men with power very often do cause diversion of brains and efforts of their fellow humans from a &nbsp;path of harmony and peaceful living to a path of disorder and harmful rather a toxic life.</p> <p> 	&nbsp;</p> <p> 	We, the new hope for earth, should take an oath from today onwards to be responsible not only to ourselves but also to other men and women, keep a strict check on the misuse of power, energy and efforts, to give back those people a life of harmony and peace who have been misled all over their lives, to strengthen human brotherhood, bondings and harmonious realations over land and seas, all across the world, and make our beautiful planet a beautiful, peaceful place to live in.</p>
